# ToDoList
a ToDoList in Java. Not finished yet


Remaining tasks:

- Be able to save changes

- Store and retrieve the date of last modification

- Sort them by last modification date?

- Finish customizing the design of alerts and the menu for creating a new ToDoList

- Be able to re-send them from the app

- Be able to delete them from the app

- Make a log file

- Manage possible errors of absence of status



BUGS TO FIX:

- When you press the delete button, the last task is always deleted and not the others

- The layout of the lists changes when you hover over the delete buttons
